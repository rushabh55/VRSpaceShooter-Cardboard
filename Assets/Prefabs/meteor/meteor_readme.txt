A simple (non-morphing) meteor prop made in Sculptris. Should work in any program that can use Wavefront objects. It has only been tested in Daz Studio 3 and Poser 8, but seeing as that it is only an OBJ file, I don't see why it won't work in other programs or versions of the programs used to test it.

This meteor is yours to use as you see fit. All I ask is that you do not redistribute it or try to sell it as if it were your own. If you use it in a commercial render, please give credit.

Remember, this is just a Wavefront OBJ file and a texture (jpg format). You will need to manually import the meteor.obj file into your program and manually set the texture. If anyone knows how to convert this to work like a typical Poser prop (with geometry, libraries, and texture folders, along with the files necessary to load the prop with the texture attatched), please email me at muffinmistress2011@gmail.com.

Enjoy your meteor!
