I have made this addon to work with Celestia v1.3.1,just unzip to your extras folder.First you will have
to edit either solarsys.ssc or asteroids.ssc (depending on which version of Celestia you have installed)
so you replace the existing code with the new code in the asteroids.ssc included with this addon.Then
you should decide which texture format you wish to use (DDS or JPG) and delete the rest in both the hires
and medres folders before starting Celestia as it may cause problems otherwise.To make the models I have 
used the standard install models and smoothed out a few of the rough edges (not enough with Mathilde though.
Any asteroids included here,that dont have a standard model are pure fiction.
The textures were made from any existing partial ones (Phil Stookes) where possible and added some fictional
data for the missing bits.For most of them they are pure fiction,though I tried to base their colour
schemes on the spectral data available for each,with help from Grant Hutchison.The Eros texture is Grant's
also (though I changed the hues slightly).With Kleopatra I have changed the way the texture is mapped
to minimise the stretching,it is such an odd shape though it still isnt great.As we know nothing about its
surface features I figured it didnt matter.Any problems Email me jestr@ntlworld.com
